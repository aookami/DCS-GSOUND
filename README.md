# DCS-GSOUND
Sound queues for G forces exported from DCS

The python script listens for socket messages in port 8075, and converts those to an audible feedback (no more snapping f14 wings!).


1. Add the contents of the Export.lua file to your lua file (usually located in ~/Saved Games/DCS.openbeta/scripts/)

2. Run the python file before you start the DCS mission


You can adjust the g-force frequency bands inside the .py file
